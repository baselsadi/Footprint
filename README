Contributing
************

Footprint is a fully blown multi-tenanted software as a service web application.
It has been opensourced so that other developers can learn from it and build on it.

It is perfectly fine to take a copy of this code and run it on your own servers or to
strip it down and take out the pieces you need. But I would encourage you to contribue
any improvements you make back into this codebase in the form of
`Pull Requests <http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/>`_ on
the `Footprint repository <https://github.com/iarfhlaith/Footprint>`_ on GitHub.

Documentation
=============

If you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will
need to add it. New classes, methods, parameters, changing default values, etc
are all things that will require a change to documentation.
